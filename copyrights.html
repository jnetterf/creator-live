Creator Live (with the exception of the flanger, reverb, filter, chorus, compressor, and phaser plugin, and with the exception of the JACK daemon shipped with Creator Live on Windows) is <B>(C) Joshua Netterfield 2012. All rights are reserved.</B> It would however not be possible without some fantastic open-source components:<br>
<ul>
<li><B>The Qt framework</B>: a cross-platform application and UI framework with APIs for C++ programming and Qt Quick for rapid UI creation. It is available free under the LGPL or for purchase under a propietary license at <A href="http://qt-project.org">qt-project.org</A>.</li>
<li><B>SoundTouch</B>: an open-source audio processing library Copyright (C) Olli Parviainen 2001-2011 for changing the Tempo, Pitch and Playback Rates of audio streams or audio files. It is available free under the LGPL at <A href="http://www.surina.net/soundtouch">surina.net/soundtouch</A>.</li>
<li><B>The JACK Audio Connection Kit</B>: a professional sound server daemon that provides real-time, low latency connections for both audio and MIDI data between applications that implement its API. On Windows, Creator Live ships with the daemon and uses the JACK API. On Linux, Creator Live only uses the JACK API. On the PlayBook (QNX), Creator Live does not use JACK. The following copyright applies to the JACK2 daemon v. 1.9.8:<br><br>

<li>The plugin which offers <b>flanger, phaser, reverb, filter, compressor, and chorus</B> is a fork of the <B>Calf Audio Plugin Pack</B> (which offers in Joshua's opinion the best open-source audio plugins, and also makes reference to Joshua's favourite animal). The fork involves adding a compatibility layer between the existing Calf Audio Plugin Pack and the Creator Live plugin API. The Calf Audio Plugin Pack contains plugins for LADSPA, DSSI, LV2, and JACK and is available at <A href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/calf/">sourceforge.net/projects/calf/</A>. The source code of the fork (which is only a Creator Live plugin) is available free-of-charge by email (simply contact joshua@nettek.ca with the string "Calf Audio Plugin Pack Fork" in the title), or on CD for the cost of media, packaging, shipping, and handling (send a prepaid physical mail with instructions to "17 Birchleaf Crescent - Toronto, ON, Canada - M9R 2L5" addressed to "Creator Live Calf Audio Plugin Pack Source Code Fork Request").

<li>This paragraph is for your information, and so as to provide a complete list of software developers Joshua Netterfield wishes to thank, but does not legally have to be here. If no ASIO driver is installed, the Windows port of Creator Live will offer to download a version of ASIO4ALL from <a href="www.asio4all.com">www.asio4all.com</A>. <B>Joshua Netterfield does not redistribute ASIO4ALL. Instead, Creator Live acts as a web browser and download manager, to help the end user download ASIO4ALL.</B> From asio4all.com, "ASIO4ALL is a hardware independent low latency ASIO driver for WDM audio devices. It uses WDM Kernel-Streaming and sometimes even more sophisticated methods to achieve its objectives." <B>It is (C) 2003-2008 Michael Tippach.</B></li>
